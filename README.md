## :scroll: About Us

After 12 years of experience in the real estate backed-credit industry, we decided to leverage our expertise by developing a proprietary technology that enables partners to monetize and build customer loyalty throughout the 10+ years lifecycle of a credit loan.

Along with that, our mindset and efforts are focused on giving Brazilians homeowners access to more affordable credit products while providing financial education through gamification.

Nowadays, Bcredi's team is composed of 110 employees split into two locations: the headquarters in Curitiba and the strategic office in SÃ£o Paulo.

As developers, we are always looking to improve our work and ourselves as professionals, following agile principles, code quality, good design and architecture to delivery high valuable software and make our lives easier. We give preference to small teams with qualified professionals over large teams with average professionals.
